Project Implementation Report: Kerala Quest

Version: 1.0

Date: October 26, 2023

Target Region: Kerala, India (Calicut, Kochi, Trivandrum)

1. Executive Summary

Kerala Quest is a location-based Augmented Reality (AR) and social role-playing game designed to promote tourism and social interaction in Kerala's famous hotspots. The application features three distinct user roles (Player, Volunteer, Admin) and relies heavily on geolocation, real-time communication, and gamification mechanics.

This report outlines the technical architecture, security measures, and implementation roadmap required to build a secure, scalable production version of the prototype.

2. Technical Architecture & Stack Recommendation

To ensure the app works smoothly outdoors (mobile data) and handles real-time location updates, we recommend a Hybrid or Native Mobile Architecture.

A. Frontend (Mobile App)

Recommended: Flutter (Dart) or React Native.

Why: You need native access to GPS, Camera (for QR scanning), and Accelerometer (for mini-games like "Coconut Catch"). These frameworks offer near-native performance on both Android and iOS from a single codebase.

Alternative (Web-First): Next.js (React) + PWA (Progressive Web App).

Why: Lower barrier to entry (no app store download needed), but has limitations with background geolocation and AR features.

B. Backend (Server & API)

Recommended: Node.js with NestJS or Go (Golang).

Why: Node.js handles real-time concurrency (websockets for chat/location) extremely well. Go is excellent for high-performance location processing if the user base grows large.

C. Database (The Core)

Primary DB: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension.

Critical: Standard SQL databases cannot efficiently query "users within 500 meters." PostGIS is the industry standard for geospatial queries.

Real-time DB: Redis or Firebase Realtime Database.

Usage: Storing transient data like "current player location" for the live Admin Heatmap and "Chat" messages.

D. Mapping & Geolocation

Map Provider: Mapbox (Recommended) or Google Maps Platform.

Why: Mapbox allows for complete custom styling (removing highway clutter, highlighting game zones) which is essential for the "Game Map" aesthetic seen in the prototype.

3. Security Architecture (The "Most Secured Platform")

Building a social, location-based app requires distinct security layers to protect users physically and digitally.

A. Location Privacy & Safety (Crucial)

Location Fuzzing: Never broadcast a player's exact coordinates to strangers.

Implementation: If Player A is at [11.2588, 75.7804], the server should send [11.2590, 75.7800] (a random point within 50-100m) to Player B. Exact location is only for the server and the user themselves.

Ghost Mode: Allow users to toggle "Invisible Mode" instantly (as seen in the prototype design).

Geofencing: Restrict "Mingle" features to verified public zones (e.g., Calicut Beach Promenade) and disable them automatically if a user strays into secluded areas.

B. Data Security

Encryption: * TLS 1.3 for all data in transit.

AES-256 for sensitive data at rest (PII, Chat logs).

Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 (Google/Apple Sign-in) combined with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management. Avoid storing passwords directly.

C. Anti-Cheat (Game Integrity)

GPS Spoofing Detection: Users will try to fake their location to solve quests without traveling.

Solution: Analyze altitude data, speed of movement (teleporting is impossible), and verify against cellular tower triangulation (on native Android/iOS).

QR Tokenization: For Volunteer scanning, QR codes should be dynamic (regenerating every 30 seconds) rather than static images, preventing screenshots from being shared.

4. Module Breakdown & Implementation Details

Module 1: The Player (Explorer)

Geospatial Triggers: The app must "wake up" when entering a hotspot (Geofence entry event).

AR Integration: Use AR.js (Web) or ARKit/ARCore (Native) for the "Halwa Run" or "Catch" games.

Social Graph: Use a Graph Database (like Neo4j) or efficient SQL relations to manage "Friend" vs "Stranger" connections.

Module 2: The Volunteer (Ops)

QR Scanner: Native camera implementation.

Task Queue: A simple ticketing system (WebSocket based) where the Admin pushes tasks ("Check Crowd at South Pier") and Volunteers accept/complete them.

Module 3: The Admin (God Mode)

Live Heatmap: Use WebSockets (Socket.io) to stream aggregated location points. Do not plot individual user dots for privacy; plot "density clusters."

Emergency Broadcast: A high-priority push notification channel (FCM/APNS) to alert all users in a specific geofence (e.g., "High Tide warning at Beach").

5. Development Roadmap

Phase 1: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Tech: React PWA + Firebase.

Features: Login, GPS location display, Simple Text Riddles (Manual input), Admin Dashboard (Basic).

Goal: Test at Calicut Beach with 50 users to verify game mechanics.

Phase 2: The "Kerala Quest" App (Production)

Tech: Migrate to Flutter + Node.js/PostGIS.

Features: Real-time Chat, Volunteer QR Scanning, Dynamic Map Layers, Inventory System.

Security: Implement Location Fuzzing and GPS Spoofing detection.

Phase 3: Social & Scale

Features: AR Mini-games, Guilds/Teams, Leaderboards per District.

Infrastructure: Kubernetes scaling for handling thousands of concurrent connections during festivals (e.g., Onam, Thrissur Pooram).

6. Regulatory Compliance (India)

DPDP Act 2023 (Digital Personal Data Protection Act): * You must obtain explicit consent for location tracking.

You must provide a "Right to be Forgotten" (Delete Account & Data).

Server Location: Hosting user data within India (e.g., AWS Mumbai region or Google Cloud Delhi) is highly recommended for latency and compliance.

7. Recommended Third-Party Services

Auth: Firebase Auth or Auth0.

Maps: Mapbox (Better styling) or Google Maps.

Push Notifications: OneSignal.

Payment (if selling items): Razorpay (Best integration for India UPI).
